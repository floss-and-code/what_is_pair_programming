# What is Pair Programming?

Pair programming is the practice of pairing up to work on programming tasks. Usually, most people imagine two developers seated at the same computer, sharing the keyboard. But with the increasing popularity of [remote coding platforms](https://www.codementor.io/pair-programming), it’s now possible to pair program thousands of miles apart.

Most forms of pair programming involve taking turns typing code or commands. One person types (the “driver”) while the other person thinks through what is being done, and what needs to be done next (the “navigator”). These roles are frequently swapped. Both members must verbalize their thought processes for pair programming to be effective. Successful pair programming relies on successful communication as much as programming skill. The premise of pair programming is that when working on a complex task, “two heads are better than one.”
